**Client (Vite + React + TypeScript)**

Quick start (from repo root):

1. Change to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

Notes:
- The app stores progress in `localStorage` under the key `wedding-checked`.
- To deploy, run `npm run build` and serve the `dist/` folder.
